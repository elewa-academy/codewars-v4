```js
function repeatStr (n, s) {
  String.prototype.repeat = function(n) {
     return (new Array(n + 1)).join(this);
  };
  return s.repeat(n);
}

console.log(repeatStr(3, "*") == "***");
console.log(repeatStr(5, "#") == "#####");
console.log(repeatStr(2, "ha ") == "ha ha ");

## Strategy 

Their strategy was to re-implement the native "repeat()" method and to overwrite the native one, then to call this method with the String argument

Their re-implementation's strategy was to create an empty array with length one greater than n (but with nothing in it), then to join the array using your string as a padding between array "elements".

## Language Features

* "Array.prototype" - tapping into native prototypical inheritance to give their string access to their method.
* "new Array(x)" - initializes a new array with length x, but nothing in it
* ".join(String)" - concatenates the elements in an array with your argument as padding.

### Comparison

Their solution is far more sophisticated than mine. Not only did they have a more cleaver solution than mine, but they reached deep into JavaScript wisdom to use it in a more clever way than I could (yet). 

But there might be some dangerous side-effects from modifying the Array prototype.
